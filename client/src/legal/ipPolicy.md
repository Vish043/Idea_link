# Intellectual Property & Collaboration Policy

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines how intellectual property (IP) and collaboration rights work on IdeaConnect. **This is informational only and does not constitute legal advice.**

## 2. Idea Ownership

### Default Ownership
- **Idea owners retain all rights to their ideas by default.**
- Posting an idea on IdeaConnect does not transfer any ownership, rights, or interests to:
  - The platform (IdeaConnect)
  - Other users
  - Collaborators (unless explicitly agreed otherwise)

### Your Responsibility
- You are responsible for protecting your intellectual property.
- Consider filing for patents, trademarks, or copyrights if appropriate for your idea.
- IdeaConnect does not provide IP protection services.

## 3. Collaboration and IP Sharing

### Important: No Automatic Rights Transfer
- **Becoming a collaborator on an idea does NOT automatically grant you any ownership or rights to the idea.**
- Collaborators do not gain IP rights simply by joining a team or contributing to discussions.

### Recommended Practice
- **For serious collaborations, discuss and document IP and revenue sharing agreements OUTSIDE the IdeaConnect platform.**
- Consider:
  - Who owns what percentage of the idea/product?
  - How will revenue be shared?
  - What happens if someone leaves the collaboration?
  - Who has decision-making authority?
- **Consult with legal professionals** to draft proper collaboration agreements, NDAs, or partnership contracts.

## 4. Platform Features and Limitations

### What IdeaConnect Provides
- A platform to discover collaborators
- Basic NDA-style disclaimers (see below)
- Communication tools (chat, tasks)
- Collaboration request system

### What IdeaConnect Does NOT Provide
- Legal agreements or contracts
- IP protection or registration services
- Dispute resolution
- Enforcement of collaboration terms
- Legal advice or counsel

## 5. NDA-Style Disclaimers

IdeaConnect offers basic "NDA-style" disclaimers for ideas marked with protected details. These are:

- **Good-faith agreements** between users
- **Not legally binding** in the traditional sense
- **Not a substitute** for proper legal documentation
- **Basic acknowledgment** that the user agrees not to misuse disclosed information

For serious business ideas, you should still use proper legal NDAs drafted by attorneys.

## 6. User Responsibilities

### Idea Owners
- Clearly communicate your expectations about IP and collaboration terms.
- Consider marking sensitive ideas as "protected" if you want basic disclaimer agreements.
- For serious collaborations, move discussions to formal legal agreements outside the platform.

### Collaborators
- Respect idea owners' intellectual property rights.
- Do not assume you have any ownership rights without explicit agreement.
- Agree to basic disclaimers if you want to view protected idea details.
- For serious collaborations, negotiate proper agreements outside the platform.

## 7. Disputes

- IdeaConnect is not responsible for resolving IP disputes between users.
- Any disputes should be handled directly between the parties involved.
- Consider mediation or legal counsel for serious disputes.

## 8. Platform Disclaimer

IdeaConnect is a connection platform only. We:
- Do not take sides in user disputes
- Do not enforce collaboration agreements
- Do not provide legal protection for ideas
- Are not liable for IP disputes or collaboration issues

## 9. Best Practices

1. **Start with clear communication** about expectations and boundaries.
2. **Use protected idea settings** for sensitive information.
3. **Move to formal agreements** when collaborations become serious.
4. **Document everything** outside the platform for important partnerships.
5. **Consult professionals** for legal, IP, and business matters.
